## 💾 Previous Version (Local Storage with SQLite)

The current version of this app uses **Firebase (cloud-based)** for note storage.  
If you would like to see the earlier implementation that used **local storage with SQLite (sqflite)**, you can check out commit [`f984f70`](https://github.com/Mali03/FlutterNoteApp/commit/f984f70).  

That version demonstrates how CRUD operations were handled locally using the `sqflite` package before migrating to Firebase.

Uygulama, kullanıcı kimlik doğrulamasını (Giriş yap, Kayıt ol), notların gerçek zamanlı olarak saklanmasını ve temel not yönetim özelliklerini (oluşturma, düzenleme, silme ve paylaşma) destekler.
